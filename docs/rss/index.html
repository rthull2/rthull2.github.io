Influence only works within people&apos;s existing goals and motivations. So let&apos;s start by looking at the motivations that drive all human behavior.</p><p>What is the goal of life? <strong>Survival.</strong></p><p>Why survival? Life is a continuous process of experimentation to create genes that survive. We exist because our genes are fine-tuned for survival. We&apos;re survival machine built by our genes. &#xA0;</p><p>How does this explain human behavior? We can trace all behavior back to the basics of survival, <strong>stay alive</strong> and <strong>reproduce</strong>. But, there&apos;s another piece for distinguishing humans from animals.</p><p>We build advanced <strong>tools</strong>. We build mental tools to better understand reality. And, physical tools to better control the environment. Our best mental tool is our use of <strong>stories</strong> to communicate ideas and organize groups.</p><p>Tools <strong>accelerate</strong> progress, but progress can be negative, or have negative side-effects. It takes time to solve these new problems. Our recent progress still has many unsolved problems. This is why we see many people behaving counter to their survival.</p><p>With this model of human behavior, what impact should we aim to have? Align your behavior with survival. Find, create, use, and spread tools that improve survival. Take careful consideration of the risks and tradeoffs.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dumb People Should Have Blogs Too.]]></title><description><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Why would anyone listen to you talk about things you don&apos;t fully understand that you learned from someone else?</p>

<p>Millions of people would consider you an expert, millions of people like your personality and trust people like you.  There is an endless amounts of useless information.  There is a bunch of useful information most people can&apos;t find or understand.  You can be a part of the pipeline from the people who can find and understand the useful information to those that can&apos;t.</p>

But first let&apos;s talk about why.</p>
<h2 id="why-have-1000-kids">Why have 1000 kids?</h2>
<p>Life is a meaningless game of replication.  The only rule is that you need to survive to continue playing.  We haven&apos;t figured out how to live forever yet, so the next best thing is to help your DNA live forever.  If you intelligence (or your genetic trait of choice) is higher than average, you&apos;re also doing humanity a favor.</p>
<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>We&apos;re looking to maximize your DNA&apos;s life-years (number of human lives * number of years).</p>
<h3 id="milestones">Milestones</h3>
<ol>
<li>Exist as long as humans exist.</li>
<li>Reach <em>common ancestor</em> status, all living humans have a piece of your DNA.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
<h3 id="standard">Standard</h3>
<p>Let&apos;s first take a baseline of the typical person with kids. They&apos;re married with 1 to 4 kids. With birth rates declining, their odds of surviving more than a couple generations is low.</p>
<h3 id="standard-plus">Standard Plus</h3>
<p>There are a few things you can do to boost your odds, while still operating within social norms.  Have 3 to 6 kids, maybe with a divorce in-between (2 wives, but not at the same time).  It might be easier to marry 2 people who want 3 kids than it is to marry 1 that wants 6 kids.  You could also invest more in your family, creating a healthy environment where your kids become marriage materials and look forward to having a family of their own.</p>
<h3 id="amish">Amish</h3>
<p>Reaching the limits of what you can do with one wife.  The Amish have a handful of cultural habits that lead them to having lots of kids.</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited distractions, a life without kids would be rather empty.</li>
<li>Farming, more kids equals more free labor.</li>
<li>Cultural norms encouraging large families.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: <a href="https://amishamerica.com/largest-amish-family-ever/">Largest Amish family ever?</a></p>
<h3 id="mormon">Mormon</h3>
<p>While no longer common, some Mormons still practice polygamy. Having multiple wives is a great way to scale up the number of kids you have.</p>
<p>Disturbing example: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqORJHyNWJc">My Six Wives And 29 Children.</a></p>
<h3 id="surrogates">Surrogates</h3>
<p>Get donor eggs (or use your wife&apos;s) and pay surrogates to carry them.  Only limited by the amount of money you&apos;re willing to pay.  Optionally, donate the kids to the government to take of.</p>
<p>Example: <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-10128323/Russian-woman-24-welcomed-TWENTY-ONE-surrogate-babies-just-year.html">Russian woman, 24, who welcomed TWENTY ONE surrogate babies in just over a year...</a></p>
<h3 id="baby-mommas">Baby Mommas</h3>
<p>Get your girlfriends (or random women) pregnant a few times, then move on to the next one.  This is less optimal in 1st world countries where women are smarter and the government will come after you for child support.</p>
<p>Example (1st world): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXY28nnxuh8">Man with 30 kids asks for a &apos;break&apos;.</a><br>
Example (3rd world): <a href="https://www.nairaland.com/4362181/jean-michel-french-sex-tourist">Jean Michel, French Sex Tourist: Slept With 1400 African Ladies, Impregnated 600.</a></p>
<h3 id="donor">Donor</h3>
<p>Women pay you to get them pregnant, typically through a sperm bank.</p>
<p>Example (Natural): <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/meet-men-sex-strangers-babies/story?id=26870643">Meet the Men Having Sex With Strangers to Help Them Have Babies.</a><br>
Example (Unlicensed): <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-35262535">I fathered 800 children, claims sperm donor.</a></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are many pros/cons I haven&apos;t mentioned, but one important question is who is raising your kids.  If you raise your own kids, they will likely be better off and more likely to have kids of their own, however you can only raise so many kids.  I recommend a mixed approach, raise as many as you can and also have as many as you can.</p>

<p>I&apos;m not advocating any of the things discussed.  This is an exercise of out-of-the-box thinking.</p>
