But if you figure out how to program people, you could have them:</p><ul><li>Program computers</li><li>Perform any task</li><li><strong>Program more people to perform tasks</strong></li></ul><p>I started thinking about programming people in high school. I thought I&apos;d learn about it in my psychology or business classes, but it was never mentioned, so I assumed it wasn&apos;t possible. Until I read &quot;<strong>The Power of Habit</strong>&quot; by Charles Duhigg. This book taught me that <s>programming</s> influencing people was possible, and more generally, there are open-secrets to be found in books.</p><p>Moving beyond the basics of influence, I wanted to know... Why does this work? What should I influence people to do? My questions continued to grow, and it became clear that understanding people means understanding almost <em>everything</em>: philosophy, biology, history, business, finance, politics, art, etc.</p><p>Now, after reading more than 200 books and watching thousands of YouTube videos across all major fields of study, it&apos;s time to start sharing what I&apos;ve learned...</p><p>First Question: <strong>Why do people do what they do?</strong></p><h1 id="survival">Survival</h1><p>Evolution, despite its many controversies, is based on a simple, undisputed mechanism. To be alive today, you must have survived yesterday. Extend this logic back as far as you&apos;d like. There are a limited number of ways to survive, a limited number of paths through history. We can make many assumptions about someone&apos;s behavior based on the fact that they&apos;re alive.</p><p>In general, people are busy staying alive and having kids. This is the driving force behind the majority of human behavior. People will underrate this due to the simplicity and perceived shortcomings:</p><ul><li>What about all the different personalities?</li><li>What about the people who choose not to have kids?</li></ul><p>Yes, there are important differences that lead to a variety of outcomes. But the differences are small. This confusion arises because we focus on the differences. But the majority of behavior is unconscious, shared by everyone, baked in so deep we don&apos;t need to think about it.</p><p>All behaviors lie on a spectrum between genetic and learned. Behaviors beneficial to survival will become more genetic over time (assuming a positive trade-off against other limitations). In other words, they&apos;ll become easier to learn and harder to break.</p><h1 id="stories">Stories</h1><p>We&apos;re wired to communicate in stories. They&apos;re essential to survival, as instructions to get (or avoid) certain results. To predict the future. The format is understandable in its simplest form: &quot;John did X and got Y.&quot;</p><p>But the complexity multiplies as you add more people. Family, school, business, country, etc. We all know these stories. We spend our lives learning all the characters and their expected behaviors. Then you find out those terms are templates. Everyone has different ideas about the definitions and expectations. And people keep making up new stuff.</p><p>A story needs people who believe in it and who can play its characters. If the story keeps them alive, the story will survive, and those traits will become more genetic over time.</p><p>There is, however, a major problem created by stories. By predicting the future, we become aware of death.</p><blockquote>What&apos;s the point if we&apos;re going die?</blockquote><p>How do we cope with this? More stories, of course. Stories about how you&apos;re not actually going to die, your family will survive, you&apos;re part of a larger system, etc. There&apos;s overlap here with the common stories we&apos;ve already mentioned (it&apos;s more efficient to have multipurpose stories). People will believe many stories, but they&apos;ll invest deeply in the ones they use to deny death.</p><p>Worse than our own death is the death of everything, nihilism.</p><blockquote>What&apos;s the point if we&apos;re all going to die?</blockquote><p>The further you think into the future, the more likely your story will collapse. This is where religious stories shine over more practical stories about genetic survival. If nihilism reduces survival, there may be a link between religious belief and thinking about the future.</p><h1 id="technology">Technology</h1><p>We build tools to better understand and control the environment. We&apos;ve made a lot of our progress on this. Most people view this progress as positive, albeit requiring a little time to adjust. But others aren&apos;t so sure.</p><ul><li>What does technology do?</li><li>What are those adjustments we&apos;re making?</li></ul><p>Like stories, technology changes the traits that survive. Technology can also change the stories that survive (or vice versa). We need time to fix the stories, changing small details or creating new stories. And time for the negatively affected people to disappear.</p><p>Changes in technology create a lot of confusion. They take forever to play out and require endless historical knowledge to understand. Confusion is another feeling that people will do anything to avoid.</p><h1 id="closing">Closing</h1><p>Forgive me for going light on the details and examples. Controversial topics require a lot of care, and I&apos;m still working on my writing skills.</p><p>In summary, we were built through survival. We play characters in stories that tend to improve survival. We build tools to control the environment, often breaking things but normally coming out ahead.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
