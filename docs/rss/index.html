This can be repeated a handful of times. Of the ten people I&apos;ve asked about this, only one has done it, and they&apos;ve only done it once.</p><p>How many are willing to spend one hour to research, sign up, and place a risk-free bet on an online sports betting site for an expected twelve hours worth of pay ($320)? This can be repeated a couple of times. Of the ten people I&apos;ve asked about this, only one has done it (the person who told me about it).</p><p>There are a few valid concerns, which I&apos;ll quickly address, but I think the true reasons go deeper.</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t want to lower my credit score.&quot; Yes, applying for a credit card temporarily lowers your score. This is only an issue for people looking to take out a loan in the next couple of months.</p><p>&quot;Is this a scam, why are they giving me free money?&quot; They make money on average, collecting lots of money from their best users. They pay you to join with the hope that you also make poor financial decisions.</p><p>There are a handful of other things you should know, such as the basics of how credit works, how you can avoid actually hurting your credit score, learning all the terminology, etc.</p><p>I think the true reason lies in the quick math people use for making decisions. For many people, researching something they&apos;re not interested in for one hour requires the same amount of mental effort they use in forty hours at their job. The math isn&apos;t so good if you&apos;re only getting $200 for forty hours worth of work.</p><p>On a similar note, why do so many people spend so little time trying to learn skills that would raise their pay? If you&apos;re going to be working full-time for the next twenty-five years at your current pay, doubling your pay either doubles the money you have or saves you 12.5 years. If it takes you one year to learn the skills that double your pay, you effectively made 12.5 years worth of money in one year. I think there&apos;s a correlation between this and the original question. If someone isn&apos;t willing to make a low cost, low reward trade, they probably won&apos;t make the high cost, high reward trade.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Get Everything on the Internet for Free.]]></title><description><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Free books, TV shows, movies, courses, applications, operating systems, etc.  Everything is free if you know what you&apos;re doing.

I&apos;m going to give you a brief tutorial.</p>
<h1 id="actually-free">Actually Free</h1>
<p>There are plenty of business models that give you stuff for free. The most common type is an ad-based model, which becomes completely free after you start using an ad blocker.  Donation based non-profits are free if you don&apos;t give them any money.</p>
<p>The only trick with this category is that you need to know about the things that are free.  Some people are still paying for Microsoft Word which Google Docs or LibreOffice would work fine.  Finding free things is often as simple as doing a web search for &quot;how to get X for free?&quot;.</p>
<h1 id="free-trials-or-free-returns">Free Trials (or Free Returns)</h1>
<p>Services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime will often offer multiple one-month trials for the same account.  If you make multiple accounts (not sure if they check to see if you&apos;re using the same credit card, but getting a bunch of credit cards isn&apos;t too hard either), you can save a decent amount of money.  Sometimes a service will be offered by a bunch of different companies, so you can rotate around through all of them.</p>
<p>Any digital content that you have access to for a limited amount of time can you downloaded, so you have access forever.  For example, given a one-month trial on Netflix, you can download every movie or show you&apos;re interested in, enough to last for years.</p>
<h1 id="file-sharing">File Sharing</h1>
<p>Find some friends that have the thing you&apos;re looking for and are willing to share it.  Given the ability to connect with billions of other people with the internet, it&apos;s not very hard to find some friends.</p>
<p>Note that the listed sites often get shutdown, so a copy with the same name but a different URL will show up to replace it.</p>
<h2 id="hosted">Hosted</h2>
<p>Books: Library Genesis<br>
Movies/TV: Putlocker, PotLocker, Movie4k</p>
<h2 id="torrents">Torrents</h2>
<p>PirateBay.<br>

<h2 id="forums-chat-rooms">Forums / Chat Rooms</h2>
<p>For niche content, users who don&apos;t know about torrents, and/or users who like to socialize.</p>
<p>You can find forums with a web search, but that also means the content gets taken down quicker.  Chat rooms are better because they are harder to find.</p>
<h1 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h1>
<p>Downloading stolen content is illegal, however you&apos;re unlikely to get in trouble for it.  If you weren&apos;t going to purchase it anyway, then getting a free copy harms no one.  If you want people to continue working on something, someone needs to pay them.</p>

<h1 id="why-do-so-many-people-love-watching-ads">Why do so many people love watching ads?</h1>
<p>From the sports watchers who don&apos;t just record the game and skip commercials, to the Youtube viewers without an ad blocker, to the illegal movie streaming viewers who prefer sites with ads...</p>
<p>Maybe they prefer the excitement of a live game, don&apos;t know ad blockers exist, and feel better morally if they aren&apos;t getting something completely for free.  But I don&apos;t think that fully explains things.</p>
<h1 id="future-doesnt-exist">Future Doesn&apos;t Exist</h1>
<p>Before watching some video, would you rather watch an ad for fifteen seconds, or spend fifteen hours figuring out how to block ads?</p>
<p>It would take 3,600 ads before your time investment is worth it. That&apos;s about 1 year if you watch 10 ads per day.</p>
<p>If you only live for another 1 year, and value your time at $1 per hour...</p>
<pre><code>1/15 ads per second * 3600 seconds per hour = 240 ads per hour.
365 days per year * 10 ads per day / 240 ads per hour = 15.2 hours saved.
15.2 hours saved - 15 hours initial cost * $1 per hour = $0.20 saved.
</code></pre>
<p>See? It&apos;s just not worth it.</p>
<p>Using more reasonable numbers like one hour to figure out to block ads, living for another 30 years, and your time being worth $25 per hour: $11,300.</p>
<p>If you don&apos;t already use an ad blocker, please go 50/50 with me on the profits.</p>
<h1 id="distraction-from-reality">Distraction From Reality</h1>
<p>For the average viewer, the ads serve the same purpose as the primary content. They&apos;re both a distraction from reality, a great way to avoid the existential dread that arises when you have some time to actually think.</p>

But first let&apos;s talk about why.</p>
<h2 id="why-have-1000-kids">Why have 1000 kids?</h2>
<p>Life is a meaningless game of replication.  The only rule is that you need to survive to continue playing.  We haven&apos;t figured out how to live forever yet, so the next best thing is to help your DNA live forever.  If you intelligence (or your genetic trait of choice) is higher than average, you&apos;re also doing humanity a favor.</p>
<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>We&apos;re looking to maximize your DNA&apos;s life-years (number of human lives * number of years).</p>
<h3 id="milestones">Milestones</h3>
<ol>
<li>Exist as long as humans exist.</li>
<li>Reach <em>common ancestor</em> status, all living humans have a piece of your DNA.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
<h3 id="standard">Standard</h3>
<p>Let&apos;s first take a baseline of the typical person with kids. They&apos;re married with 1 to 4 kids. With birth rates declining, their odds of surviving more than a couple generations is low.</p>
<h3 id="standard-plus">Standard Plus</h3>
<p>There are a few things you can do to boost your odds, while still operating within social norms.  Have 3 to 6 kids, maybe with a divorce in-between (2 wives, but not at the same time).  It might be easier to marry 2 people who want 3 kids than it is to marry 1 that wants 6 kids.  You could also invest more in your family, creating a healthy environment where your kids become marriage materials and look forward to having a family of their own.</p>
<h3 id="amish">Amish</h3>
<p>Reaching the limits of what you can do with one wife.  The Amish have a handful of cultural habits that lead them to having lots of kids.</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited distractions, a life without kids would be rather empty.</li>
<li>Farming, more kids equals more free labor.</li>
<li>Cultural norms encouraging large families.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: <a href="https://amishamerica.com/largest-amish-family-ever/">Largest Amish family ever?</a></p>
<h3 id="mormon">Mormon</h3>
<p>While no longer common, some Mormons still practice polygamy. Having multiple wives is a great way to scale up the number of kids you have.</p>
<p>Disturbing example: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqORJHyNWJc">My Six Wives And 29 Children.</a></p>
<h3 id="surrogates">Surrogates</h3>
<p>Get donor eggs (or use your wife&apos;s) and pay surrogates to carry them.  Only limited by the amount of money you&apos;re willing to pay.  Optionally, donate the kids to the government to take of.</p>
<p>Example: <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-10128323/Russian-woman-24-welcomed-TWENTY-ONE-surrogate-babies-just-year.html">Russian woman, 24, who welcomed TWENTY ONE surrogate babies in just over a year...</a></p>
<h3 id="baby-mommas">Baby Mommas</h3>
<p>Get your girlfriends (or random women) pregnant a few times, then move on to the next one.  This is less optimal in 1st world countries where women are smarter and the government will come after you for child support.</p>
<p>Example (1st world): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXY28nnxuh8">Man with 30 kids asks for a &apos;break&apos;.</a><br>
Example (3rd world): <a href="https://www.nairaland.com/4362181/jean-michel-french-sex-tourist">Jean Michel, French Sex Tourist: Slept With 1400 African Ladies, Impregnated 600.</a></p>
<h3 id="donor">Donor</h3>
<p>Women pay you to get them pregnant, typically through a sperm bank.</p>
<p>Example (Natural): <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/meet-men-sex-strangers-babies/story?id=26870643">Meet the Men Having Sex With Strangers to Help Them Have Babies.</a><br>
Example (Unlicensed): <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-35262535">I fathered 800 children, claims sperm donor.</a></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are many pros/cons I haven&apos;t mentioned, but one important question is who is raising your kids.  If you raise your own kids, they will likely be better off and more likely to have kids of their own, however you can only raise so many kids.  I recommend a mixed approach, raise as many as you can and also have as many as you can.</p>
