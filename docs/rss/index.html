You could make someone program computers for you. But is it possible? It was never mentioned in my psychology class, so I didn&apos;t pursue the idea further.</p><p>Until I read &quot;The Power of Habit&quot; by Charles Duhigg during an in-school suspension. After finding out that <s>programming humans</s> influencing people is possible. And that I could learn more from a book in one day than from a class in 18 weeks. I became obsessed with the topic and with reading in general.</p><p>My initial research led to deeper questions:</p><ul><li>Why do people do what they do?</li><li>What should I influence them to do instead?</li></ul><p>These might look more familiar in their personalized form:</p><ul><li>Why am I like this? </li><li>What should I do with my life? </li></ul><p>If people struggle to answer these for themselves, I&apos;d need to do a lot of research before giving a generalized answer. So I began a long journey of learning everything I could about human behavior and the world.</p><p>After reading over 200 books, among other methods of learning, I&apos;m ready to share what I&apos;ve learned. My goal is to raise awareness of rare, useful ideas. Let&apos;s start with an overview of the three core ideas behind human behavior.</p><h1 id="survival">Survival</h1><p>Evolution, despite its many controversies, is based on a simple, undisputed mechanism. To be alive today, you must have survived yesterday. Extend this logic back as far as you&apos;d like. There are a limited number of ways to survive, a limited number of paths through history. We can make many assumptions about someone&apos;s behavior based on the fact that they&apos;re alive.</p><p>In general, people are busy staying alive and having kids. This is the driving force behind the majority of human behavior. People will underrate this due to the simplicity and perceived shortcomings. What about all the different personalities? What about the people choosing not to have kids? Yes, there are important differences that lead to a variety of outcomes. But the differences are small. This confusion arises because the differences are what we focus on. Ignoring the unconscious behaviors shared by everyone, baked in so deep we rarely think about them.</p><p>All behaviors lie on a spectrum between genetic and learned. Behaviors beneficial to survival will become more genetic over time. (Assuming a positive trade-off against other limitations). In other words, they&apos;ll become easier to learn and harder to break.</p><h1 id="stories">Stories</h1><p>We&apos;re wired to communicate in stories. They&apos;re essential to survival, as instructions to get (or avoid) certain results. The format is understandable in its simplest form: &quot;John did X and got Y.&quot;</p><p>But the complexity multiplies as you add more people. Family, school, business, country, etc. We all know these stories. We spend our lives learning all the characters and their expected behaviors. Then you find out the expectations are different everywhere you go. And people keep changing them.</p><p>For a story to survive, it needs people who believe in it and who can play its characters. If the story keeps them alive, these traits will become more genetic over time.</p><p>Stories also create a big problem. As a mechanism for predicting the future, they&apos;ve made us aware of death. How do we cope with this? With more stories, of course. Stories about how you&apos;re not actually going to die, you&apos;re part of a larger system, etc. These are generally good for survival, but they also create conflict. People are willing to die for the stories that protect them from death.</p><h1 id="technology">Technology</h1><p>We build tools to better understand and control the environment. Most people view this progress as positive, albeit requiring a little time to adjust. But others aren&apos;t so sure. What does technology do? What are those adjustments we&apos;re making? Technology changes the people and stories that will survive. We need time to adjust our stories. To try and save the people that got pushed off the boat. Or make sure they don&apos;t tip over the boat as they drown.</p><p>These adjustments can take centuries to play out. This creates a lot of confusion for the short-term thinkers who don&apos;t know history. Confusion is a strong motivator. Like death, people will make up anything to avoid it.</p><h1 id="closing">Closing</h1><p>Forgive me for going light on the details and examples. I&apos;m dancing through controversial ideas, trying not to crash. They&apos;re rare for a reason. You can fill in the details yourself, or wait for me to become a better dancer.</p><p>In summary, we were built through survival. We play characters in stories that tend to improve survival. And we build tools to control the environment, often breaking things. But, always coming back stronger (so far).</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
