But if you figure out how to program people, you could have them:</p><ul><li>Program computers</li><li>Perform any task</li><li><strong>Program more people to perform tasks</strong></li></ul><p>I started thinking about programming people in high school. I thought I&apos;d learn about it in my psychology or business classes, but it was never mentioned, so I assumed it wasn&apos;t possible. Until I read &quot;<strong>The Power of Habit</strong>&quot; by Charles Duhigg. This book taught me that <s>programming</s> influencing people was possible, and more generally, there are open-secrets to be found in books.</p><p>Moving beyond the basics of influence, I wanted to know why it worked. And what should I influence people to do? My curiosity lead to more questions, and it became clear that understanding people means understanding: philosophy, biology, history, business, finance, politics, art, etc.</p><p>Now, after reading more than 200 books (and watching thousands of YouTube videos) across all major fields of study, it&apos;s time to start sharing what I&apos;ve learned...</p><p><strong>Why do people do what they do?</strong></p><h1 id="survival">Survival</h1><p>To be alive today, you must have survived yesterday. We know many things about your path to the present because there are a limited number of ways to get here.</p><p>The general strategy is to <strong>stay alive and have kids</strong>.</p><p>This is the root of human behavior, but it feels like we&apos;re missing something. There are many behaviors that don&apos;t obviously relate to survival. And many types of people, including those who decide not to have kids.</p><p>The idea that isn&apos;t obvious is <strong>the majority of behaviors come from unconscious decisions</strong>.</p><p>We&apos;re all running mental scripts in our head. They&apos;re imperfect, unable to handle every unique circumstance in a changing environment. They&apos;re learned from your experiences, culture, or genetics, so there&apos;s overlap between different people, but also room for many different outcomes.</p><p>If these decisions are important, why aren&apos;t we aware of them?</p><p>Consciousness is for making new decisions, not for repeating important ones. Over time, important decisions progress from being conscious to unconscious to genetic.</p><p>In short, people behave through unconscious scripts pointed towards survival, but influenced by their experiences, culture, genetics, etc, </p><h1 id="stories">Stories</h1><p>We&apos;re wired to communicate in stories (conscious scripts). They&apos;re essential to survival, as a way to <strong>predict and/or control the future</strong>. The format is understandable in its simplest form: &quot;John did X and got Y.&quot;</p><p>But the complexity multiplies as you add more people. Family, school, business, country, etc. These are stories we all know. Each with roles we spend our lives learning and playing.</p><p>For a story to survive, it needs people to play the roles. And if the story, in turn, helps them survive... <strong>motivating traits, among the story&apos;s actors, begin moving from conscious to genetic</strong>.</p><p>One major drawback of stories and predicting the future is we become aware of death. Stories aren&apos;t very motivating when they end with &quot;and then he died and everyone soon forgot about him&quot;.</p><p>How do we cope with this? More stories, of course.</p><ul><li>You&apos;re not <em>really </em>going to die</li><li>Your family will survive</li><li>Some project, system, or idea of yours will survive</li></ul><p>Of the many stories people believe, <strong>they&apos;ll invest most deeply in the ones they&apos;re using to deny death</strong>.</p><p>Worse than our own death is the death of everything, nihilism. What&apos;s the point if we&apos;re all going to die? The further you think into the future, the more likely your story will collapse. At this point, your options are to adopt a religion, or stop thinking so much.</p><p>In short, people live through stories, and prefer ones that promote survival and allow them to deny death.</p><h1 id="technology">Technology</h1><p>We build tools to better understand and control the environment, and then build better tools. This process leads to <strong>exponential growth</strong>.</p><p>Is growth good or bad? In theory, every step forward increases our odds of survival (after a little time to adjust). In reality, that step forward might be a step over the edge of a cliff.</p><p>To be more specific, technology changes which traits survive (same as stories). And also changes which stories survive (or vice versa). This creates a <strong>dangerous instability</strong>. It takes time to make counterbalancing adjustments.</p><p>In short,<strong> </strong>fast changes are dangerous, but we&apos;re accelerating.</p><h1 id="closing">Closing</h1><p>In conclusion, people do what their internal or external scripts tell them to do. The scripts are written for survival, but things don&apos;t always go as planned.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
